<h1>A serious game to study the effect of limited field of view in keyhole surgery.</h1>

This research project aims to design and deploy a serious web-based game to study the effect of limited field of view in endoscopic (keyhole) surgery. Surgeons use endoscopes to relay real-time images to a monitor to help them manipulate their way around the body, however there is a limited field of view. There is currently very little quantitative data around the effects of limited field of view in endoscopic surgery. Therefore, this work aims to acquire relevant and meaningful data, as well as educate people on this limitation via a novel and engaging game.

You are being invited to take part in a research project to study the effect of limited field of view in keyhole surgery. I confirm that I understand that by ticking each box below I am consenting to this element of the study.
